![PWIM LOGO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1337hero/pwim-wp/master/screenshot.jpg "PWIM LOGO")

## A kickass WordPress theme for an awesome event! 

Located in Utah's eastern desert, Moab is one of the most breathtaking 4Ã—4 destinations in the nation. During Power Wagons in Moab folks get to experience the red desert from mesa top to canyon bottom.

This theme was custom built & copyrighted by [Mike Key][1] of [1337 Hero, LLC][2] for [Offroad Treks, LCC][3].

### Notes

A lot of this theme is hard-coded for speed. It stands as an example of what a fast and efficient WordPress theme can be, without all of the usual bloat associated with WordPress. :sunglasses:

I make use of Gulp to compile and build my SASS & JS for this theme. And use GULP to deploy to my server the theme itself.

If you want to use this theme, you'll need to run NPM Install to setup the gulp workflow.

You'll want to look inside /_lib/engage.php to see what is going on with the Dev & Production environments too.

**I make no warranties and will not provide instructions for this theme.**
